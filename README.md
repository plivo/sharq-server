SHARQ Server
============

SHARQ Server is an flexible, rate limited queuing system based on the [SHARQ Core library](https://github.com/plivo/sharq) and [Redis](https://redis.io).

## Overview

SHARQ Server is a flexible, open source, rate limited queuing system. Based on the [Leaky Bucket Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#The_Leaky_Bucket_Algorithm_as_a_Queue), SHARQ lets you create queues dynamically and update their rate limits in real time.

SHARQ consists of two components - the core component and the server component. The [SHARQ core](https://github.com/plivo/sharq) is built on [Redis](https://redis.io), using Python and Lua, and the SHARQ Server is built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) and talks HTTP.

## Installation

SHARQ Server can be installed using [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) as follows:

```
pip install sharqserver
```

## Running the server

SHARQ server can be started with the following command. A simple SHARQ config file can be [found here](https://github.com/plivo/sharq-server/blob/master/sharq.conf).

```
$sharq-server --config sharq.conf
```

Ensure the SHARQ server is up by making a HTTP request.

```
$curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
{
  "message": "Hello, SharQ!"
}
```

## Development

### With Docker & Docker Compose

> Pre-requisites: Install latest stable versions of Docker and Docker Compose.

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. From repository root, run:

```bash
make start
```

3. Sharq server will be up and running at `http://localhost:8000`.

> Note: Try out `/status/` & `/deepstatus/` (checks connectivity with Redis) endpoints.
